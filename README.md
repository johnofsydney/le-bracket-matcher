# le-bracket-matcher

This is an implementation of what I was trying to describe in the interview. It mostly works

I've added tests, including one that fails

I think that in my next iteration I would instead loop through the array, removing any pair of adjacent matching brackets, and then recursively call the method in a similar manner
